This thesis presents design and implementation of a~data structure, which tries
to combine advantages of both databases and regular data structures.
Main advantages of databases we try to retain are data persistence
through storing data on a~hard disk and working with data using
transactions which allows us parallel access
without danger of inconsistency. From data structures
we borrow the implementation as a~library of functions and the aim on simplicity
and storing data in memory.
Our implementation is built around the concept of (software) transactional
memory; all data are stored on hard drive as log of operations.
